# norequest plugins

[![ci](https://github.com/norequest/plugins/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/norequest/plugins/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A plugin marketplace for AI coding agent CLIs: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex,
Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. One repo, one marketplace, and each
plugin installs with a single command from your own CLI.

## Add the marketplace

**Claude Code**

```
/plugin marketplace add norequest/plugins
```

**OpenAI Codex**

```
codex plugin marketplace add norequest/plugins
```

Gemini and Copilot CLI have no marketplace concept; they install a plugin
directly from this repo (see the per-IDE rows below).

## Plugins

| Plugin | What it does | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **cost-guard** | Cost and runaway control for AI coding agents: loop detection, failure streaks, call and time budgets, deny or checkpoint before spend runs away | [plugins/cost-guard/README.md](plugins/cost-guard/README.md) |

## Install cost-guard: pick your IDE

| IDE | Install | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add norequest/plugins` then `/plugin install cost-guard@norequest` | runtime ✅ (flagship) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `codex plugin marketplace add norequest/plugins` then `codex plugin install cost-guard@norequest` | schema-only ⚠️ |
| **Google Gemini** | `gemini extensions link ./plugins/cost-guard/gemini` (from a repo clone) | schema-only ⚠️ |
| **GitHub Copilot (CLI)** | `copilot plugin install norequest/plugins:plugins/cost-guard` | schema-only ⚠️ |
| **Cursor** | `plugins/cost-guard/install/install.sh cursor .` (from a repo clone) | runtime ✅ (CI smoke) |
| **GitHub Copilot (cloud agent)** | `plugins/cost-guard/install/install.sh copilot .` then commit `.github/hooks/cost-guard.json` | runtime ✅ (CI smoke) |

`runtime` = the install path is exercised end to end (Cursor and Copilot cloud run
in CI on every push; Claude Code is the flagship dev target). `schema-only` = the
wiring is validated against the CLI's current docs but has not yet been run against
that CLI.

Full per-IDE details, requirements, and caveats:
[plugins/cost-guard/README.md](plugins/cost-guard/README.md).

## Repo layout

The repo root holds the marketplace manifests. Each plugin lives under
`plugins/<name>/` with its own core, adapters, installer, tests, and README.

```

Gemini and Copilot CLI have no marketplace concept, so they install the plugin
straight from its subdirectory: Copilot via the subdir path
`norequest/plugins:plugins/cost-guard`, Gemini by linking the
`plugins/cost-guard/gemini` extension folder from a local clone. Both manifests
live inside the plugin, so the marketplace root stays plugin-agnostic.
